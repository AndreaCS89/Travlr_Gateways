# Travlr_Gateways
Developed a responsive and user-friendly website for Travlr Gateways that allows clients to securely log in, view available trip details, and manage their travel plans.

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
In my full stack project, I used Express for rendering HTML and managing routes, while JavaScript handled dynamic client-side interactions. I also used a single-page application (SPA) structure to streamline user experience by loading content dynamically without refreshing the page. Unlike Express HTML, which is more static, SPAs increase interactivity and performance by reducing server calls and allowing smooth transitions between views. Every approach offered unique benefits. While Express provided ease of routing, SPA improved the user experience with a seamless, application-like interface. I chose a NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend due to its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB allows storing data in a schema-less format, which is very suited for handling unstructured data, like travel information that can vary between users. Its document-based structure makes it easier to scale horizontally, which is great for applications with dynamic and evolving data requirements. Additionally, MongoDB integrates well with Node.js, making it a great fit for the JavaScript-centric full stack project.

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is different from JavaScript itself in that it is purely a data format, not a programming language. It plays a crucial role in tying together the frontend and backend of the application by enabling data to be exchanged seamlessly between them. For example, when a client edits or adds a trip, the data is formatted in JSON on the frontend and then sent to the backend, where it's processed and stored in the database. During development, I refactored code by breaking down complex UI components into reusable parts, which improved the efficiency of the development process. Reusable UI components helped maintain consistency across the application and made future updates easier to implement.

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**
In full stack applications, testing endpoints involves verifying methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to ensure data is correctly retrieved or submitted. While using Postman, I encountered frequent errors due to the server not connecting, which was frustrating. I realized that some of these issues came from missing important instructions during setup. This experience taught me to slow down, carefully follow instructions, and ensure that the backend server was properly configured before testing endpoints. By taking my time and sticking to the details, I was able to successfully resolve the issues and ensure secure data flow between the frontend and backend.

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
This course has significantly advanced my professional skills by deepening my understanding of full stack development. I have mastered the use of both frontend and backend technologies, including Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript, which are highly marketable in todayâ€™s tech world. The experience of building a complete web application has helped me grow as a developer. I now feel more confident in applying for roles in web development, as I have gained practical, real-world skills that are directly applicable to industry demands.
